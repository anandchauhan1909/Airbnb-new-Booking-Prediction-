Predicting the top 5 destinations a new user is most likely to make a booking by analyzing their basic details for example: age, sex and the website browsing history. We have a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. We are predicting which country a new user's first booking destination will be. All the users in this dataset are from the USA.

There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found), and 'other'. Please note that 'NDF' is different from 'other' because 'other' means there was a booking, but is to a country not included in the list, while 'NDF' means there wasn't a booking.
